* // ---------- RENAMING A FILE ---------- // *
// If you rename the file in the folder, it says the original file is deleted and there is a new untracked file
// After staging the changes, git then recognises that the file has been renamed.
// If approximately 50% of the file is the same, it assumes that it has been renamed.

# Simpler way to rename/move a file
