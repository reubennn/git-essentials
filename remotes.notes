* // ---------- REMOTES ---------- // *
// Local Git repositories do not require a network connection
// Remote repositories ("remotes") are hosted by servers over a network
// Remotes allow easy collaboration
// Push local repository changes to the remote
// Fetch remote changes to the local repository
// Git is designed to be a distributed version control
// All repositories are the same
// Often, one remote is designated as the primary repository for collaboration

# Add a remote w/ URL
git remote add origin <URL of the repo> // Convention is to call the primary main remote "origin"
// On the repo page in GitHub, press "Clone or download" and copy the HTTP URL

# List all remotes
git remote
git remote -v // More information on your remotes (URL etc.)

# Show remote branches
git branch -r

# Show all branches
git branch -a

* // ---------- PUSH ---------- // *
// Push local commits to the remote server

# Push an existing repository to a remote that is not being tracked yet
git push -u <remote name> <branch to push> // The -u option means to track the branch

# Push an existing repository to a remote
git push <remote name> <branch to push> // The -u option means to track the branch

# Push the current branch to the tracked remote
git push

// The remote can be viewed in the .git\config file

* // ---------- FETCH ---------- // *
// Pull commits from the remote server to the local machine

# Clone a remote repository
git clone <URL> // If no name is specified, it will use the git repository to create a directory
git clone <URL> <name of directory to clone to>

# Snchronise with the remote repository and pull all data
git fetch
OR:
git fetch <name of remote>
// Performing a fetch will not affect the current branch
// It purely check in with the server to see if there are any changes

Best practice:
    - Fetch before you work
    - Fetch before you push
    - Fetch before you go offline
    - Fetch often

* // ---------- TRACKING ---------- // *
// If the remote branch is not tracked, then it needs to be specified each time you push/pull
// If it is, then the remote branch does not need to be specified

// If the -u option was not specified when creating the remote,
# Track a remote branch
git branch -u <upstream> <branch name>
// upstream e.g. = origin/non_tracking

# Untrack a branch
git branch --unset-upstream <branch name>

Note:
// origin/master is the tracking branch for the remote branch (it is not the actual remote branch)
// It is a tracking branch that is on the local machine

* // ---------- DELETE REMOTE ---------- // *
# To delete a remote
git remote rm <name of remote>
