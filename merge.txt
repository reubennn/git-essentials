//Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge <name of branch to be merged>

// ---------FAST FORWARD MERGE VS. REAL MERGE --------
Fast-forward: 
When merging, no new commit is needed to be created, 
it is moved to the end of the branch being merged to

Real merge (non-fast forward): 
A new commit is created to join the two branches together,
say if there is commits in between.
