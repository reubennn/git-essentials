//Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge <name of branch to be merged>

// ---------FAST FORWARD MERGE VS. REAL MERGE --------
Fast-forward: 
When merging, no new commit is needed to be created, 
it is moved to the end of the branch being merged to

Real merge (non-fast forward): 
A new commit is created to join the two branches together,
say if there is commits in between.

// --------- MERGE CONFLICT --------
* Abord merge
* Resolve the conflicts manually
* Use a merge tool

//Abort the merge
git merge --abort

//Show differences between the branches
git show --color-words_

// --------- STRATEGIES TO REDUCE CONFLICTS --------
* Keep lines short
* Keep commits small and focused
* Beware of stray edits to whitespace (spaces, tabs, line returns)
* Merge often
* Track changes to master
    - Keep merging master into the new feature branch periodically
    - This allows conflicts to regularly be resolved
    - Once the new feature is complete, merge back into master
    - Merge shouldn't have too many conflicts due to the ongoing up-keep
