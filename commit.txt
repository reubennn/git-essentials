//Adds every file in the current directory to the staging index (will then be tracked)
git add .

//Then, commit everything in the index with a message:
git commit -m "Type a brief summary of the change here <50 characters"
//Make sure that the summary is in present tense

//Check the working tree status:
git status

Check previous changes:
git log
git log -n 5 // Only display the 5 most recent commits

//View changes in working directory
git diff

//View changes in the staging (cached) area
git diff --staged
OR
git diff --cached
