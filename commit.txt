//Adds every file in the current directory to the staging index (will then be tracked)
git add .

//Then, commit everything in the index with a message:
git commit -m "Type a brief summary of the change here <50 characters"
//Make sure that the summary is in present tense

//Check the working tree status:
git status

Check previous changes:
git log
git log -n 5 // Only display the 5 most recent commits
git log --oneline //Display on the first line of the commit messages

//Stages AND commit all changes to tracked files
git commit -a
OR
//Note that this does not include untracked files

//Multi-line commit message
git commit -a
//A new file will open up. Type the multi-line commit message at the top. Start with main heading,
//Then double line break and type the detailed commit message with changes
