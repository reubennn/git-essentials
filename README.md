## ✨ This Repo: A Handy Reference

Consider this repository a handy reference for all your Git commands!

### 📦 What Can I Find Here?

It contains detailed information & notes regarding various Git commands, along with use-case examples to make sense of some more complicated commands. It covers a wide range of different Git features, from adding a commit, to branching, remotes, logging, staging, stashing, tagging, merging, rebasing to pushing a commit to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### 🔍🧲 How Can I Find the Information I Need?

Simply clone the repo, open it up in your favourite code editor, and perform a "search all files" for a particular word or phrase. Let's hope the information is there!

## 🔮 Future Steps

- Most of the files are in .notes which I originally used as I had a fancy VSCode extension which prettified these files. What I did not know at the time, was that it would look ugly in GitHub. I'll do my very best to convert these .notes files to .md so they look nice to view in GitHub.
- There isn't really any proper organisation here. In the future, I may try to organise it a little better so it is easier to find information.
